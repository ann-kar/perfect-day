## About the project

It's a habit tracker app. But what makes it stand out?
- it's focused on "now" - instead of showing statistics in the main page, it focuses on the tasks to do today.
- gamification (visual enhancements as prizes)
- original design

## Motivation

Own purposes. I couldn't find an app that would meet all my needs (listed above) so I decided to create one.

## Production stage

Early development stages - a work in progress!

## How to use

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
